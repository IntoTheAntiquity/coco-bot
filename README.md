## Trying to Clone CocoBot


This is my attempt to try and clone a discord bot that has already been preworked on.
Cocobot is located in IntelliJ just clarification. So when you already have code on your computer and youre trying to clone it you need to create a new repository on github. Then open the terminal on nagivate to the folder that holds in my case it is called the GitFolder. Clone the new repository you made with " git clone <newrepository> "

COMING SOON........

## When changes are made here this is how to get it on tyrajr


cd /path/to/cloned/directory in this case where i put coco-bot

Fetch changes from github with " git fetch origin "

Merge Changes with " git merge origin/main "

verify the changes with ls

(optional) Pull Changes in One Step with " git pull origin main " instead of fetching and merging separatly
