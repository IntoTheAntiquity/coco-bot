## Trying to Clone CocoBot


This is my attempt to try and clone a discord bot that has already been preworked on.
Cocobot is in IntelliJ

## When changes are made here this is how to get it on tyrajr


cd /path/to/cloned/directory in this case where i put coco-bot

Fetch changes from github with " git fetch origin "

Merge Changes with " git merge origin/main "

verify the changes with ls

(optional) Pull Changes in One Step with " git pull origin main " instead of fetching and merging separatly
